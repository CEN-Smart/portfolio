  skill:"I am a developer with deep skill of flexibility, which is the ability to learn unlearn and relearn. The main knowledge is problem-solving which involves finding a problem, knowing the problem, and solving the problem. I think that is what made me a developer not just knowing how to code. With my fast learning ability, I can attend to any problem, learn any needed technology (if needed) and solve the problem. I am also an Engineer and a Mathematician who chose to build a design skill through coding. Designing has been my passion and i have developed myself in problem-solving not just writing codes (that is my advantage). I grow up in my field as a designer and a problem solver, that is what made me a developer."
